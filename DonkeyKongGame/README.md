# DonkeyKong Game Description

I developed a Donkey Kong game using C# and XAML, focusing on collision detection and user interface design. This project involved implementing collision detection algorithms to manage character interactions and using XAML for the layout and visuals. Through this work, I enhanced my skills in object-oriented programming within the .NET framework, and gained practical experience in real-time game mechanics.
