# Texas Holdem

I developed a Texas Holdem poker game, which involved programming the core mechanics of the card game including shuffling, hand evaluations, and betting sequences. I used a specific programming languages C# and XAML, along with data structures like arrays or lists to manage the deck and player hands. This project not only improved my coding skills but also my understanding of algorithm design and game logic implementation.
